As a software craftsmanship apprentice, I've been wanting to write and share tokens to help grow the community and fellow apprentices.

Seeing articles from renowned and well-respected software craftsmen in their humble beginnings serves as a driving force and an inspiration. Although I have tried a couple of times to write consistently, success has been far-fetched.

But the irony is, you better write to write better. I pledge to embrace the challenge.

I am no proficient writer, nor am I a software craftsman. I intend to use this blog as a garden to nurture my writings and software craftsmanship. Correction of errors, the identification of weak notions, and suggestions for improvements are warmly welcomed.

From time to time, my writings would be on software engineering, cool stuff I am working on/learning, personal successes, and some milestones reached.

**Off topic?**

I would try to reduce off-topic writings.

**Schedule?**

Starting from today, I will release a fortnightly article on Fridays.

**Why call the blog Quest?**

*Quest:*  
a long or arduous search for something.

Becoming a craftsman in all endeavors doesn't just take time, takes much energy as well.

Interested in exclusive updates and insights on the pursuit of software craftsmanship?
