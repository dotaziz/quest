I began 2023 on a positive note, balancing full-time remote work with education and exploring various parts of Ghana for leisure. During my travels, I embraced new experiences like kayaking and rock climbing, the latter proving to be a life-changing adventure. It initially evoked fear, but I soon realized it boiled down to three principles: lean, feed, and step.

To lean on the rope symbolizes trust in a power greater than everything. Without this trust, you're exposed to unnecessary risks, akin to attempting to navigate challenges beyond your capacity. Trusting the rope doesn't guarantee control or instant victory; rather, it serves as a foundation for your endeavors, demanding hard work for success.

Feeding the rope, in conjunction with leaning, entails investing effort and actions. Mere reliance on trust isn't sufficient; you must actively contribute to your journey, secure in the belief that the support is there.

The step is where personal responsibility comes into play. Every decision and judgment you make is a step, and every 'rock' you lean on represents a personal choice. This navigation skill is crucial for realizing your goals and aspirations.

In summary, lean on a power greater than yourself, feed in actions and work with trust as your foundation, and step into every decision with the understanding that the steering wheel is in your hands. Drive as you desire, but never forget the significance of trust and effort to propel you forward.
